@par Example Description 

Virtual_COM_Port is the application to be used with the BlueNRG GUI SW package 
(STSW-BNRGUI). 
The BlueNRG GUI is a PC application that can be used to interact and evaluate the 
capabilities of the BlueNRG-2 device both in master and slave role. The BlueNRG GUI 
allows standard and vendor-specific HCI commands to be sent to the device controller 
and events to be received from.
  
  
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32 Nucleo devices with BlueNRG-2 STM32 expansion board
    (X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1)
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics:
    - NUCLEO-L476RG RevC board

  
@par How to use it? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
 - Open IAR toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with
   Embedded Workbench V8.32.3).
   Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision toolchain (this firmware
   has been successfully tested with V5.27.1) or the STM32cubeIDE (this firmware 
   has been successfully tested with Version 1.1.0).
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
 - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" 
   folder included in the distributed package.
